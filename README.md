# Leetcode-Insights
This repo is not about pushing every LeetCode question I solve.
It’s about storing the questions where I actually learned something new, something that made me stop and think —
“Oh… I knew this concept, but I never used it this way before.”

So every folder here contains:

the question that taught me an insight

the code I wrote

a small explanation of what exactly I learned

basically the moment where my understanding leveled up a little

This repo is more like my personal learning journal for DSA.
Whenever I discover a trick, a pattern, or a clever use of something I already knew, it goes here.

It’s simple, but it helps me remember how my thinking evolved over time.
